A workbench plugin for the [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) Web UI. After Workbench is opened in Conversation, chat stays on the left. Two new columns appear on the right: the editor (syntax highlighting and terminal) and files, Git, and usage.

## Interface

The workbench uses a three-column layout. Conversation stays on the left. The two columns on the right are the new capability area: editor and terminal in the center; file tree, Git, and usage on the far right.

## Core capabilities

1. **Workbench layout.** Three columns: Conversation on the left, editor and terminal in the center, files / Git / usage on the right. A new session opens the workbench immediately. By default the editor is collapsed, the files/Git sidebar is open, and usage is pinned above Settings. Columns can be resized, collapsed to icon rails, and restored. Collapse, the files/Git tab, and the usage pin are remembered globally across reload and new sessions.
2. **Smart terminal.** A local PTY. Real shell lines (including pasted `$ ls`) go straight to the terminal; natural language is translated and typed into the **current** shell. Notes are non-executable. A configurable blacklist blocks destructive commands the assistant would otherwise type.
3. **Workspace editor.** CodeMirror 6 with syntax highlighting, Plain / Emacs / Vim keymaps, Markdown edit / preview / split, image and spreadsheet previews, Git diffs, tabs, breadcrumbs, save and dirty-close guards.
4. **Files.** Tree browse, filter, hidden files, `.gitignore` marks, new / rename / delete, and open in a local editor (Cursor, VS Code, and others).
5. **Git.** Status, stage, commit (including streamed AI messages), fetch / pull / push with safety checks, branches, merge, restore, commit graph, `git init`, and model-facing `git_*` tools.
6. **Usage.** Official balance, this-machine observed spend, session tokens and context, pin above left Settings (including the collapsed rail), and a compact balance on the status bar.
7. **Status bar.** Open-file tabs, balance, Feedback, version / upgrade, workspace path, branch, dirty count, editor mode.
8. **Maintenance & privacy.** In-UI upgrade checker, Chinese / English UI, and redaction of tokens in paths and errors.

## Feature list

### Workbench

- Three-column layout: Conversation | editor + terminal | files / Git / usage
- Opens as soon as you create a session; no first message required
- Header **Workbench** button shows or hides the whole workbench
- Drag column widths; double-click a sash to reset; widths are remembered
- Collapse Conversation, editor, or the right dock into a narrow icon rail

### Editor

- Multi-file tabs; save; unsaved indicator; confirm before closing dirty files
- Close all / others / left / right
- Path breadcrumbs
- Syntax highlighting: JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, TSX, JSON, HTML, CSS, Markdown, Python, XML, YAML; other files stay plain text
- Keymaps: Plain / Emacs / Vim from the status bar; the choice persists; **Emacs is the default** so typing is insertion, not Vim normal mode
- Markdown: edit, preview, or split; GFM; http(s) and workspace-relative images; [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) 11 fenced blocks; workspace file links open in the editor; unsafe links are blocked
- Git working-tree diffs and commit diffs open as editor tabs
- Image preview: png, jpg, jpeg, gif, webp, avif, bmp, ico
- Table preview: csv, tsv, xlsx (UTF-8, then GB18030 if the file looks garbled). `.xls` is recognized but opens in an external app
- New empty file; new terminal tab (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd>)

### File tree

- Browse, expand, open, new, rename, delete (with confirmation)
- Toggle hidden files; `.gitignore` ignored files are marked
- Filter by file name
- Open a file or the whole workspace in Cursor, VS Code, VS Code Insiders, VSCodium, Windsurf, Zed, or the system default (only apps that are actually installed)
- Truncation notice when a folder is too large to list in full

### Git

- `git init` plus `user.name` / `user.email` when the folder is not a repo
- Staged / unstaged / untracked lists
- Stage, unstage, and whole-section actions
- Discard unstaged edits or delete untracked files (with confirmation)
- Open a file diff in the editor
- Commit, commit all, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>
- Streamed AI commit messages; customizable template
- Fetch / pull / push. Dirty tree, behind remote, detached HEAD, and missing upstream block the unsafe click. No `--force`
- Pull mode: merge / fast-forward only / rebase. Push mode: normal / force-with-lease
- Switch branch, create and switch, merge (conflicts abort cleanly)
- Ahead / behind counts and remote probe
- GRAPH: commit graph, compact by default (message-only; can switch to full), copy hash, expand files, open a commit diff, drag height; compact/open and Git settings are remembered
- Conversation tools: `git_status`, `git_diff`, `git_log`, `git_branch`, `git_commit` (commit needs user approval; no delete / `reset --hard` / `clean`)

### Usage

- Official API balance; currency mark follows the API (`¥` for CNY, `$` for USD)
- Observed spend on this machine (top-ups do not erase it). The official key API does not return lifetime spend
- Session tokens: input / output / cache hit / cache write / hit rate
- Context occupancy
- Link to the official usage page
- Pin above the left **Settings** control; unpin back to the right dock. Pin still works when the left rail is collapsed (compact strip)
- Drag height without covering the session list; content scrolls without a visible scrollbar
- Status-bar balance to the left of **Feedback**; `—` (or `¥—` / `$—`) when the balance cannot be read

### Status bar

- Scrollable open-file tabs
- Balance, Feedback (GitHub Issues), version (GitHub repo), upgrade entry (npm)
- Workspace path (tokens redacted), current branch, dirty file count
- Editor-mode menu

### Smart terminal

- Local xterm.js PTY in the workspace directory
- Command vs. natural-language classification; pasted prompt prefixes such as `$ ls` still count as commands
- Multiple tabs (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd>); each tab has its own PTY and AI-assist state; the first terminal tab stays pinned
- AI command assist (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> or the sparkle button)
- Notes / greetings / warnings written as non-executable statements
- Configurable destructive blacklist (assistant-typed only; what you type in the PTY is not blocked)
- Assist settings: separator line, one-line explanation, direct-run of real commands, custom translation prompt
- Interrupt (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>), reconnect, copy output
- POSIX shells: bash / zsh / sh / dash. Windows: Git Bash, then Windows PowerShell. See [Workspace terminal](#workspace-terminal)

### Maintenance

- Chinese and English UI
- Dismissible upgrade notice; install command pasted into the terminal as a `#` comment
- Tokens, passwords, and Bearer keys are redacted in UI text and errors; URLs keep host and path

## Release

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Package | [`dsh-workbench-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dsh-workbench-plugin) |
| Version | **0.1.18** (npm tag `latest`) |
| Registry | https://registry.npmjs.org |

```
+ dsh-workbench-plugin@0.1.18
```

Maintainers publish npm with `bash devops/release.sh`. The script uses the existing `npm login` session on this machine. Credentials must not be stored in the repository.

The app market installs from GitHub (`github:loadingvx/deepseek-harness-workbench-plugin`). That path does **not** compile on the user's machine. Before every GitHub push: `bash devops/build.sh`, then commit `lib/index.js` and `lib/client.js` together with the source.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

[DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) is installed, and `dsh web` can be started.

### Procedure

1. Install the plugin (pin the version; do not omit `@0.1.18`):

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-workbench-plugin@0.1.18
```

`dsh plugin add` is implemented with pnpm. pnpm 11 waits **24 hours** after a version is published before it will pick it as `latest`. A bare `dsh-workbench-plugin` (no `@version`) can therefore install **0.1.0** and still exit 0. Pinning `@0.1.18` requests that release explicitly.

If a pinned install is still refused as too new, add this to `~/.dsh/profiles/web/pnpm-workspace.yaml` and run the command again:

```yaml
minimumReleaseAgeExclude:
  - dsh-workbench-plugin
```

2. Restart `dsh web`.
3. Open http://127.0.0.1:3080, enter **Conversation**, and create a new session. Workbench opens on the right immediately — you do not need to send a first message. After the first turn, the header **Workbench** button can hide or show it.

### App market / GitHub

The market command installs the GitHub tree, not the npm tarball:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add github:loadingvx/deepseek-harness-workbench-plugin
```

This only works when the default branch already contains built `lib/index.js` and `lib/client.js`. A source-only commit will fail: pnpm blocks the git-hosted `prepare` script unless the user adds `allowBuilds`. After install, restart `dsh web` and open Workbench as above.

## Upgrade

### Automatic notice

When a lower version is already installed, a dismissible notice appears at the top of the Files / Git sidebar. The upgrade description and install command are written to the workspace terminal as `#` comments and are not executed. Remove the leading `#`, press Enter, then restart `dsh web`.

```bash
# dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-workbench-plugin@<latest>
```

If the registry lookup fails, no notice is shown. Dismissing the notice skips only that latest version; a subsequent newer release will prompt again.

### Upgrading from 0.1.1

**Version 0.1.1 does not include the upgrade checker and will not display the notice.** Install 0.1.18 manually using the command above. Later releases will prompt in the UI.

## Workspace terminal

The workspace terminal is a local pseudo-terminal (PTY). AI command assist converts natural language into shell commands and writes them into the **current session** shell; greetings and notes are written as non-executable statements and are never executed. Shell coverage — tested and not yet tested — is summarized in the [capability matrix](#capability-matrix).

### Allowed shells — POSIX

| Name | Selection criteria | Assist verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **bash** | `$SHELL` is bash; otherwise the default when `$SHELL` is not one of the remaining rows | Verified (including `failglob` and interactive history expansion) |
| **zsh** | `$SHELL` is zsh | Verified (including default `nomatch`). Interactive zsh does **not** treat `#` as a comment by default, so notes are not written as a bare `#` line |
| **sh** | `$SHELL` is sh; otherwise the fallback when bash and zsh are unavailable | Verified. `/bin/sh` may be a symlink to bash or dash; the symlink target is used as-is |
| **dash** | Only when `$SHELL` is explicitly dash (`/bin/dash`, `/usr/bin/dash`, or `/usr/local/bin/dash`) | Same POSIX `:` no-op as sh. Dash is **not** included in the default candidate list |

### Allowed shells — Windows

| Name | Selection criteria | Assist verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Git Bash** | Probed at `C:/Program Files/Git/bin/bash.exe` and `C:/Program Files/Git/usr/bin/bash.exe`; selected when present | Not yet covered by tests |
| **Windows PowerShell** | Probed at `%SystemRoot%/System32/WindowsPowerShell/v1.0/powershell.exe`; selected when Git Bash is absent | Not yet covered by tests |

### Path constraints

Absolute paths are accepted only under `/bin`, `/usr/bin`, or `/usr/local/bin`, and only for the four POSIX names in the table above (for example `/bin/bash`, `/usr/bin/zsh`). On Windows, absolute paths to the Git Bash and PowerShell executables are accepted. All other paths, including custom installs under a home directory, are ignored so that unknown programs are not executed.

### Selection order

On Windows, Git Bash is probed first, followed by the system PowerShell, then the POSIX candidates below. The POSIX order is:

1. `$SHELL` (must be on the allowlist)
2. `/bin/bash`
3. `/usr/bin/bash`
4. `/bin/zsh`
5. `/usr/bin/zsh`
6. `/bin/sh`
7. `/usr/bin/sh`

If none of these paths are available, the terminal cannot start. Shells not yet covered by tests (fish, tcsh, csh, ksh, mksh, cmd, and BusyBox invoked as `ash`) are listed in the [capability matrix](#capability-matrix): when `$SHELL` points to one of them, the value is ignored and the terminal falls back to a tested shell when available. BusyBox is treated as **sh** only when the operating system exposes it as `/bin/sh`; the name `ash` is not yet covered by tests.

## AI command assist

<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd> opens a new terminal tab; each tab keeps its own isolated PTY session and AI-assist state.

<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (or the sparkle button in the terminal toolbar) opens the AI command assist bar of the active terminal. It translates natural-language requests into shell commands and writes them into the shell of that terminal; no separate shell is started. Greetings, warnings, and the one-line explanation preceding a command are written as non-executable statements and are never executed.
